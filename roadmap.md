# Just a poker project
## by ajaniramon


things to do:

- create an api and import it
- create a shitty frontend to display matches
- then convert that api into a websocket server
- make that websocket server let play two people a match
- then make it moke likely a real game
- have a shitty poker websocket game


- in the future: connect it with my secret project
- stress load test it and try to take it down
